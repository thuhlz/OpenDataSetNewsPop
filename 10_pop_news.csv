The retailer launched Monday an experimental browsing tool that lets users discover movies and TV shows based on their genre preferences or simply the mood they're in.
Movies and shows are divided up into categories, some of which bear the names of genres (i.e., ""Comedy"" and ""Mystery/Thriller""), and others which are labeled by mood, such as ""Feel-Good"" and ""Exciting."" Users can toggle between TV shows and movies, and apply filters to show only videos that are available for free viewing to Prime subscribers, or ones that bear G or PG ratings.
It's pretty basic, but it sure beats the haphazard organization of Amazon's current Instant Video page, which mixes rows of new releases with bestsellers and personal recommendations.
The move is the latest in a series of investment's Amazon is making in its streaming video platform. Last week, the company inked a licensing agreement with A+E Networks to bring past seasons of shows from A&E, History, Lifetime and Bio to its streaming library ó shows, it should be noted, that Netflix subscribers lost access to in the fall. Amazon claims its streaming Prime catalog now numbers more than 33,000, double what it was a year ago."

The AP announced Monday that it will share sponsored tweets from Samsung throughout this week for the International CES taking place in Las Vegas. The news service will let Samsung post two tweets per day to the AP's Twitter account, which has more than 1.5 million users, and each of these tweets will be labeled ""SPONSORED TWEETS.""

This marks the first time that the AP has sold advertising on its Twitter feed, and the company says it spent months developing guidelines to pave the way for this and other new media business models.

For this particular promotion, Samsung will provide the sponsored tweets and non-editorial staff at the AP will handle the publishing side. In this way, the company hopes to maintain a clear dividing line between its editorial and advertising operations on Twitter.

""We are thrilled to be taking this next step in social media,"" said Lou Ferrara, the AP managing editor overseeing its social media efforts, in a statement. ""As an industry, we must be looking for new ways to develop revenues while providing good experiences for advertisers and consumers. At the same time, advertisers and audiences expect AP to do that without compromising its core mission of breaking news."""

Apple announced Monday that the App Store has now passed 40 billion downloads since launching in 2008, with nearly 20 billion apps downloaded in 2012. The company had a particularly strong holiday season, with 2 billion app downloads in December alone.

The App Store hit the 25 billion mark in March and passed 35 billion in October.

It has been an incredible year for the iOS developer community,‚Äù said Eddy Cue, Apple‚Äôs senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, in a statement. ‚ÄúDevelopers have made over $7 billion on the App Store, and we continue to invest in providing them with the best ecosystem so they can create the most innovative apps in the world.‚Äù

Just as importantly, the company revealed that there are now more than 500 million active accounts in the App Store, showing the growth of Apple's user base.

In total, there are now 775,000 apps in Apple's App Store, with more than 300,000 apps specifically designed for iPad. That's up from 700,000 total apps in October, with about 250,000 iPad-specific apps at the time."

Ford will be rooting for Notre Dame all the way from space during the BCS Championship game against Alabama tonight.

Ford is currently living on the International Space Station, where he commands a six-man team, but tonight his heart will be with Notre Dame óhis alma mater ówhen the team faces off with Alabama's Crimson Tide in Miami.

""The team's played great,"" Ford said in a recent interview with Notre Dame officials on NASA TV. ""Obviously the defense is very special, and the offense is just really clicking. I'm looking forward to a great game on the seventh of January.""

 

Ford has been living on the space station since October, when he blasted off aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket. He took charge of the space station's Expedition 34 crew a month later and will return to Earth in March. He is a native of Montpelier, Ind., and is a retired colonel in the U.S. Air Force.

Ford said he tried to keep up with Notre Dame's games while on his current spaceflight, but he admitted the timing of the games is a challenge. The space station runs on Greenwich Mean Time, so many of the football games last well into the wee hours of the morning for Ford."

The carrier announced two new U-Verse-enabled apps Monday, Twonky Beam and Pix & Flix, which allow U-verse customers to share photos and videos from their smartphones on their U-verse connected televisions.

For video, U-verse customers can now use Twonky Beam. Recently made available for Roku and Xbox 360 as well, the app lets you share a compatible video from your smartphone on your television with the simple swiping gesture.

Photos can be shared on the big screen using Pix & Flix. The app allows you to ""throw"" photos from your smartphone to your television for quick viewing, and once connected to your Facebook account, you can view photos from the social network on the big screen as well.

""TV is becoming a more interactive experience than ever, and that's reflected in the latest apps to hit our U-verse enabled platform,"" said Jeff Weber, President of Content and Advertising Sales, AT&T Home Solutions. ""We're excited to work with more developers to deliver more second-screen apps to customers.""

AT&T also announced a new video on demand subscription package for U-verse customers. Called the U-verse TV Screen Pack, the $5 a month service will give customers unlimited, instant playback of an extensive library of movies on U-verse TV, Uverse.com and on the U-verse app for tablets and smartphones.

Monday's announcements were made as part of AT&T's Developer Summit, an event being held by the carrier in Las Vegas alongside CES.

6,http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/beewi-smart-toys/,BeeWi's Smart Toys Put Your Smartphone in Control,"LAS VEGAS ó RC toys have traded in their bulky remote controls for the gadget in your pocket. Take the new line of smart toys from BeeWi, introduced this week at CES 2013. The company's new fighting helicopters, soccer-playing robots and four-wheelers all rely on iOS and Android devices for control.

Like another iPad-controlled device, Parrot's popular AR.Drone, the big-wheeled ScaraBee ($149.99) lets you steer via simple on-iPad (or iPhone) controls ó it connects via ad-hoc Wi-Fi ó and includes a camera so you can see what the toy sees. Unlike the Drone, ScaraBee only records up to one minute of VGA video. It does drive for 15 minutes on a charge. I took the bot for a quick test drive and found the controls simple, though not entirely intuitive. I assume I'd get better with practice. The company also introduced TankBee, which connects to mobile devices via Bluetooth.

 BeeWi Helicopter Stinger

BeeWi's RC helicopters, also controlled by iOS and Android devices, do have cameras, but only the infrared sort, which they use to see other helicopters and stationary targets ó the latter of which can ""shoot"" back. Five hits and the $119 StingBee slowly loses altitude until it lands back on the ground. There's also a $69.99 version that cannot shoot or read infrared beams. Perhaps the most entertaining new BeeWi toy is the little KickBee. Smaller than all the other robots, it comes with a tiny plastic ball. As with all the other BeeWi products, you can control it via a mobile device but, in this case, you'll want to make sure someone else also has one of the $54.99 robots so you can play a pickup game of soccer. Now imagine a field of these little guys, each one controlled by someone with a smartphone, working as teams to drive the rubber ball into a goal. Sounds like fun.

The company is also unveiling a set of iOS and Android device controlled Mini Coopers and a Fiat 500 toy later this year. Company officials told me they're also quite close to Windows Phone 8 versions of their remote control apps."

It was on display at the International CES where we got to take a look at the new device. Now, with the addition of some new accessories, it looks more like arm candy.

Gwen Smith with BodyMedia says the face of the new sensor is smaller, about the size of an iPod nano, with an optional strap that has heart rate sensors in it.

There are interchangeable faceplates to choose from as well so you literally dress your tracker to match your style. They've also added a black face and strap to appeal to a more masculine audience. The BodyMedia, like other fitness devices, lets you upload data right to its app or online software. It also integrates with other fitness apps like Runkeeper and My FitnessPal.

There's no price for the new Core 2 monitor yet, but expect it to run between $119 and $149 when it launches."

Canon's PowerShot N wants to help via a new Creative Mode that will create five ""artistic"" photos of your original, mixing up the composition, color and lighting in a quest for the best possible picture.

Once you've got your masterpiece, the camera makes it easy to share it thanks to built-in Wi-Fi. Once you set up the Mobile Device Connect feature and download the companion app (iOS and Android) on your smartphone or tablet, you can easily relay pics and videos.

To help you get those difficult shots, the PowerShot N has shutter and zoom controls both on the top of the camera and the bottom of the lens. The tilting 2.8-inch touch LCD also features a touch shutter, letting you snap pics just by touching the screen.

Rounding out the specs: The CMOS image sensor captures images up to 12.1 megapixels as well as 1080p video. The optical zoom goes up to 8x. It's just 1.15 inches thick. There's also a power-saving ECO mode that will dim the screen and cut the screen timeout to 10 seconds.

The PowerShot N is coming in April for $299.99. It'll be available in white or black."

10,http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/chuck-hagel-website/,Obama Defense Nominee Chuck Hagel Targeted by Smear Website,"Mere hours after President Barack Obama put forth Chuck Hagel as his choice for Secretary of Defense, a pro-Israel group launched a website with the goal of scuttling the nomination.

 

The website, ChuckHagel.com, was launched by the Emergency Committee for Israel, and claims that Hagel ""is not a responsible option"" for the cabinet position.

The Emergency Committee for Israel is described on its website as ""committed to mounting an active defense of the U.S.-Israel relationship by educating the public about the positions of political candidates on this important issue."" The interest group, led by right-wing commentator and Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, has already posted an anti-Hagel video to YouTube that knocks his stance on economic sanctions and military action against Iran.



Hagel, a former senator from Nebraska, has in previous comments said that military action against Iran would be ill-advised. He has been criticized by many conservatives and some liberals for those stances and for being, in their view, insufficiently supportive of Israel.

The brewing controversy over Hagel's nomination is leading some analysts to expect less than smooth sailing when the Senate votes on his nomination.

The committee also plans to buy ad placements on Google that will appear when users search for ""Chuck Hagel,"" according to Yahoo."
